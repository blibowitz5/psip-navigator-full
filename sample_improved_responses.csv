"Hi! I have frost bite on my finger and want to see a hand specialist. Is this covered? What do I need to do?","To see a hand specialist for frostbite, you will likely need to check if a referral is required from your primary care doctor, as many insurance plans have this requirement for specialist visits. Additionally, if you choose to use telemedicine to consult with a specialist, be aware that the cost-sharing may differ from other outpatient services, so it's a good idea to review the schedule of benefits for specific details.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specify whether frostbite treatment is covered or if a referral is necessary, so I recommend contacting your insurance provider directly for clarification on these points.

    "original_response": "To see a hand specialist for frostbite, you will likely need to check if a referral is required from your primary care doctor, as many insurance plans have this requirement for specialist visits. Additionally, if you choose to use telemedicine to consult with a specialist, be aware that the cost-sharing may differ from other outpatient services, so it's a good idea to review the schedule of benefits for specific details.\n\nUnfortunately, the provided context does not specify whether frostbite treatment is covered or if a referral is necessary, so I recommend contacting your insurance provider directly for clarification on these points.\n\nSources:\n- Master_Policy.pdf (page 69)\n- Master_Policy.pdf (page 61)",
